#  Phishing Email Analysis & Investigation Project  

## ðŸ”¹ Overview  
This project simulates a **real-world phishing campaign** and documents the **SOC analyst investigation process** from email delivery to artifact collection and reporting. The phishing email was crafted to appear as a **voicemail notification from Office**, leading victims to a fake login page where credentials could be harvested.  

The project demonstrates both the **attackerâ€™s perspective** (hosting a phishing page, logging credentials) and the **defenderâ€™s perspective** (analyzing the phishing email, capturing traffic with Wireshark, and extracting IOCs).

## ðŸ”¹ Lab Network Architecture  

| Component        | Role / Purpose | IP Address |
|------------------|----------------|------------|
| **pfSense Firewall** | DHCP management, lab network isolation, LAN gateway | 192.168.0.1 |
| **Attacker Machine (Ubuntu)** | Hosted phishing page with Python HTTP server, captured User-Agent strings and harvested credentials | 192.168.0.13 |
| **Victim Machine (Windows 10)** | Received phishing email, opened voicemail link, interacted with phishing login page | 192.168.0.12 |
| **SOC Analyst Workstation** | Performed email header analysis, packet review, and artifact collection using Wireshark, Sublime, MXToolbox, Google Admin Toolbox, REMnux | 192.168.0.11 |
| **Phishing Web Server (Python)** | Served fake voicemail login page and logged credential submissions | 192.168.0.13 (same as attacker) |
| **Wireshark Capture Point** | Captured SMTP, DNS, and HTTP/HTTPS traffic for analysis | Between Victim & Attacker |
