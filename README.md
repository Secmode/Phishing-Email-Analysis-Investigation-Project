#  Phishing Email Analysis & Investigation Project  

## üîπ Overview  
This project simulates a **real-world phishing campaign** and documents the **SOC analyst investigation process** from email delivery to artifact collection and reporting. The phishing email was crafted to appear as a **voicemail notification from Office**, leading victims to a fake login page where credentials could be harvested.  

The project demonstrates both the **attacker‚Äôs perspective** (hosting a phishing page, logging credentials) and the **defender‚Äôs perspective** (analyzing the phishing email, capturing traffic with Wireshark, and extracting IOCs).

## 3. Body & Social Engineering Techniques

- Claims to be from **Microsoft Voicemail Service**.  
- Urgency tactic: "Message will be deleted after 24 hours."  
- Call-to-action: Click "Listen to Voicemail" button.  
- Spoofed branding (uses "Office365" in sender domain).  

üì∏ *Screenshot Placeholder: Email body preview highlighting the malicious link*

## 4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### URLs
- `http://192.168.0.13/index.html` ‚Üí Malicious link disguised as voicemail button.  
- `http://192.168.0.13:8000/tracking_pixel.png?id=voicemail_lab_20250830` ‚Üí Tracking pixel beacon.  

### Email Addresses
- **Sender:** voicemail@office365-support.com (spoofed)  
- **Reply-To:** cyberlocal@proton.me  

### Attachments
- `Voicemail_Transcription.txt` (benign in this lab sample, but would normally be analyzed with sandboxing).  

üì∏ *Screenshot Placeholder: URL analysis on urlscan.io / VirusTotal*

---

## 5. Tools Used

- **Header Analysis:** Thunderbird / Outlook / M365 Message Trace  
- **IOC Extraction:** `EIOC.py` (or `emldump` / `emlAnalyzer`)  
- **URL Analysis:** [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io), [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)  
- **WHOIS / DNS:** `whois`, `nslookup`, `dig`  
- **Attachment Analysis:** [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com), Any.Run sandbox  
- **Traffic Capture (Lab):** Wireshark / tcpdump  

---

## 6. Analysis Notes

- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all **failed** ‚Üí Strong indicator of spoofed sender.  
- **Voicemail theme** is a common phishing lure.  
- Link points to **internal lab IP (192.168.0.13)** but in real-world cases this would be an attacker-controlled server.  
- Tracking pixel indicates attacker monitoring for email open events.  

üì∏ *Screenshot Placeholder: Authentication results showing SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail*

## 7. Verdict

**Result:** üö® Malicious (Phishing Attempt)  

- Social engineering (urgency + voicemail lure).  
- Failed authentication mechanisms (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).  
- Malicious embedded link and tracking pixel.  

---

## 8. Containment & Defense Actions

1. **Determine Scope**  
   - Review M365 message trace to check if similar emails were delivered.  
   - Search email security logs for sender/reply-to/subject IOCs.  

2. **Containment**  
   - Quarantine the email in Exchange Admin Center.  
   - Block sender domain (`office365-support.com`) and `proton.me` in mail flow rules.  

3. **Proactive Defense**  
   - Add phishing URLs to URL blocklist (Defender / proxy / firewall).  
   - Educate users: Awareness campaign on voicemail-themed phishing emails.  
   - Monitor for beaconing attempts from `tracking_pixel.png`.  

üì∏ *Screenshot Placeholder: Quarantined email in Exchange Admin Center*

## 9. Lessons Learned

- Always verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment.  
- Voicemail and missed call phishing themes remain highly effective.  
- Tracking pixels are often overlooked but provide adversaries with reconnaissance.  

---

‚úÖ **Final Status:** Email confirmed as phishing. IOC list shared with SOC detection team.  

---


5. **SOC Report Creation**  
   - Findings documented into a structured SOC report with IOCs and mitigation recommendations.
